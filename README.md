# zenpaperwallet.com
JavaScript Client-Side ZEN Wallet Generator using [zencashjs library](https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/zencashjs) and inspired by [bitaddress.org](https://github.com/pointbiz/bitaddress.org)

Download the source code and run:

## Install node packages:
```npm i```

Optionally if not installed yet (node will give a warning in the previous step):

```npm install typescript```

## If you get security warnings run:
```npm audit```
and follow the instructions

## finally build the site:

```
npm run build
```

Disconnect your internet for maximum safety when generating cold wallets.
You can find the site in the /build folder, so assuming you have used git clone in the htdocs/public/www/... folder on your localhost, you can browse to: http://localhost/zenaddress/build
